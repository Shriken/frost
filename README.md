### To do:

- Debug VGA utils
  - Hardware cursor moves to the wrong spot
  - Strings don't print, or print blank (memory issue?)
- Read up on how the memory segmentation works
  - Which registers do what?
  - Difference between real mode and protected mode
  - Write some experiments to ensure that I understand it
